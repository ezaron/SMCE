Aha -- even though I can mirror my fossil repo to github, I don't think I
can push changes and propagate them back into fossil easily. Thus, for
my own development, I need fossil inside the SMCE, but I can point others
to the git repo as needed.

Install fossil in my SMCE:opt/bin/

Also -- I keep getting hung up not being able to cut-and-paste among
windows as I would like. Is there an emacs-nox binary I can put in the
VM? ... not easily. Would need to assemble all the libraries in a common
directory and then build a static version myself.

WGLMakie in Jupyter: very slow and ends in complaint about unable to connect to web server.
CairoMakie in Jupyter: Seems to work fine, if a little slow.

Login at NASA Daskhub http://dh.eis-sealevel.mysmce.com/

Settings:Text Editor Keymap: set to emacs

Close any open tabs to make the Launcher appear. Choose the Terminal.

Edit .bashrc and .profile to set the PATH.
export PATH=/home/jovyan/opt/bin:${PATH}

mkdir -p /opt/src
cd opt/src
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.7/julia-1.7.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf julia-1.7.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd
mkdir -p opt/bin
ln -s /home/jovyan/opt/src/julia-1.7.3/bin/julia /home/jovyan/opt/bin

julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
Now, when you open the Launcher tab, the Julia 1.7.3 option is shown.

Open a Julia notebook or use the terminal to run the julia interpreter:
Getting the prerequisites:
using Pkg
Pkg.add.(["netCDF", "ColorSchemes", "Interpolations", "Makie"])
-- hmmm. Seems to be very slow.
run(`pwd`)
using NetCDF
using Makie
x = collect(0:0.01:2*pi)
lines(x,cos.(x))
-- Seems to work!
-- See https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/tutorials/basic-tutorial/

Put datafiles in opt/data
HRET_v8.1_compressed.nc
HRET_v8.1_modes.nc

-- Takes a long time to upload. Is there any way to go direct from
drive.google.com?

Hmmm. Network error. It says my server is unavailable.
Felix says there is a 10GB quota.
Looks like my downloads were interrupted. I did not hit quota.

Experiment with github to mirror a fossil repo.
Create the repo at github https://github.com/ezaron/SMCE.git
On ebi:
create a fossil repo under SMCE/fossil
cd SMCE/fossil
fossil git export /home/ezaron/SMCE/git-mirror --autopush https://token@github.com/ezaron/SMCE.git
Seems to work! Hooray.
Note: "fossil git export" is needed to sync the repo. The autopush does not seem to work.

Try to get rclone binary and see if you can use it copy files from drive.google.com.
In JupyterLab Terminal:
cd
cd opt/src
curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
rm rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
cd rclone-*-linux-amd64
ln -s /home/jovyan/opt/src/rclone-v1.59.0-linux-amd64/rclone /home/jovyan/opt/bin

Hmmm. Try this:
#!/bin/bash
fileid="5b0b7d5d-128c-4210-9ea3-5000f276d629"
html=`curl -c ./cookie -s -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=${fileid}"`
curl -Lb ./cookie "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&`echo ${html}|grep -Po '(confirm=[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+)'`&id=${fileid}" -o ${filename}
I can't seem to find the fileid in the shareable url.

Continue with rclone setup:
Upload ebi:.config/rclone/rclone.conf to /home/jovyan/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
rclone copy gdrive:public/HRET_v8.1_compressed.nc .
rclone copy gdrive:public/GEBCO_gridone_distance_to_coastline_v2.0m.nc .
Seems to work!

According to Denis, there is a 10GB quota for ordinary users. Need to talk to Jinbo, eventually, about the
larger files.

Next:
 - get a sample altimeter file and make HRET predictions.
 - email Denis about east/west DaskHub stuff
